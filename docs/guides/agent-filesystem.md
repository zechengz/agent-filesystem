# Agent Filesystem Guide for Agents

This document is for AI coding agents using Agent Filesystem (AFS). Read it
before you create workspaces, edit files, configure MCP, or run the AFS CLI.

## Core Model

AFS is workspace-first. A workspace is a complete file tree for source code,
prompts, notes, generated files, logs, and agent scratch state.

Redis is the canonical store for workspace metadata, manifests, blobs,
checkpoints, live roots, and activity. Local folders, mounts, the web UI, CLI,
SDKs, and MCP tools are all surfaces over that same workspace model.

- [TypeScript command reference](../reference/typescript.md)
- [Python command reference](../reference/python.md)
- [MCP tool reference](../reference/mcp.md)

Remember these rules:

- File edits change the live workspace state.
- File edits do not automatically create checkpoints.
- Checkpoints are explicit restore points.
- Forks create a second workspace from another line of work.
- The canonical starter workspace name is `getting-started`.
- Use `Self-managed` in user-facing copy for the control-plane-backed mode.

## Pick The Right Access Path

Use MCP when your client has AFS MCP tools. This is the most direct agent path.

Use the CLI when you are operating from a shell, setting up a local runtime, or
debugging configuration.

Use sync mode when humans, editors, language servers, tests, or shell tools need
a normal directory on disk.

Use live mount mode when you specifically need a live filesystem view. On macOS
AFS uses NFS; on Linux it uses FUSE. Sync mode is usually the friendlier
default.

## Agent Operating Loop

1. Identify the workspace.
2. Inspect before editing.
3. Create a checkpoint before broad or risky changes.
4. Make focused edits.
5. Validate with the relevant build, test, or CLI command.
6. Create a checkpoint after a useful result if the state should be preserved.
7. Report the workspace, changed paths, validation, and checkpoint name.

Do not assume an implicit active workspace. Pass a workspace explicitly, or use
a mounted workspace when the command supports mount-based selection.

## MCP Setup

For local stdio MCP, configure your client with an absolute path to the `afs`
binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-filesystem": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/afs",
      "args": ["mcp", "--workspace", "getting-started", "--profile", "workspace-rw-checkpoint"]
    }
  }
}
```

Profiles:

| Profile | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `workspace-ro` | Workspace-bound read-only file tools. |
| `workspace-rw` | Workspace-bound read/write file tools. This is the default. |
| `workspace-rw-checkpoint` | Read/write file tools plus checkpoint operations. |
| `admin-ro` | Broad read-only workspace administration. |
| `admin-rw` | Broad read/write workspace administration. |

Common workspace-scoped MCP tools:

| Tool | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `workspace_current` | Confirm which workspace the MCP server is bound to. |
| `file_list` | List directory contents. |
| `file_glob` | Find files or directories by basename glob. Use this for filename discovery. |
| `file_grep` | Search exact file contents. Use this when the text or regex is known. |
| `file_query` | Rank files for a concept or natural-language question. |
| `file_read` | Read a whole file. |
| `file_lines` | Read a specific line range. |
| `file_write` | Create or fully overwrite a file. Use carefully. |
| `file_create_exclusive` | Create a file only if it does not already exist. |
| `file_replace` | Replace exact text after inspecting the file. |
| `file_insert` | Insert content at a known line. |
| `file_delete_lines` | Delete a known line range. |
| `file_patch` | Apply structured patches. Prefer this for precise edits. |
| `checkpoint_list` | List saved restore points. |
| `checkpoint_create` | Save the current live state. |
| `checkpoint_restore` | Restore a saved checkpoint. This overwrites live state. |

## CLI Quick Start

Authenticate and create a workspace:

```bash
afs auth login
afs ws create getting-started
afs ws mount getting-started ~/getting-started
```

Import an existing directory:

```bash
afs ws import --mount-at-source my-project ~/src/my-project
```

Create checkpoints around important changes:

```bash
afs cp create my-project before-agent
# make edits
afs cp create my-project after-agent
afs cp list my-project
```

Fork for parallel work:

```bash
afs ws fork my-project my-project-experiment
afs ws mount my-project-experiment ~/my-project-experiment
```

Run the MCP server:

```bash
afs mcp --workspace my-project --profile workspace-rw-checkpoint
```

## CLI Command Reference

| `afs auth logout` | Clear cached authentication. |
| `afs auth status` | Show authentication status. |
| `afs setup` | Configure the default local mode. |
| `afs status` | Show daemon status and local workspace mounts. |
| `afs ws mount [workspace] [directory]` | Mount a workspace at a local folder. |
| `afs ws unmount [workspace|directory]` | Unmount a workspace and preserve local files by default. |
| `afs ws list [--json]` | List workspaces. |
| `afs ws create <name>` | Create an empty workspace. |

## Config Commands

Use the key-based config commands:

```bash
afs config get redis.url
afs config set config.source self-managed
afs config set controlPlane.url http://127.0.0.1:8091
afs config set mode sync
afs config list
afs config reset
```

Useful keys:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `config.source` | `cloud`, `self-managed`, or `local`. |
| `controlPlane.url` | Self-managed control plane URL. |
| `controlPlane.database` | Database choice when the control plane has more than one database. |
| `mode` | Local runtime mode: `sync` or `mount`. |
| `redis.url` | Standalone Redis connection URL. |
| `agent.name` | Human-friendly agent name used in attribution. |

## Editing Rules For Agents

- Read the file before changing it.
- Prefer precise patches over full rewrites.
- Use `file_glob` for filename discovery, `file_grep` for exact content
  search, and `file_query` for conceptual search.
- Preserve user changes you did not make.
- Create a checkpoint before destructive or broad edits.
- Do not restore a checkpoint unless the user asked or you are certain the live
  state can be overwritten.
- Keep generated artifacts, dependencies, logs, and machine-local files out of
  imported workspaces with `.afsignore`.

Example `.afsignore`:

```gitignore
node_modules/
.venv/
dist/
build/
*.log
.DS_Store
```

## Search Guidance

Use `afs fs grep` or `file_grep` when you know the exact text, regex, or glob.
Literal searches use the Redis Search indexed path when it is available, then
verify candidate file contents through AFS.

Use `afs fs query` or `file_query` when you have a concept or natural-language
question. Plain query is the recommended hybrid surface and currently falls
back to keyword-ranked results until hybrid vector/rerank is complete. Keyword
ranking uses Redis Search BM25 over query chunks when available, then falls
back to direct content ranking. Use `query --keyword` for keyword-only ranking.
Use `query --semantic` when you specifically need vector-only retrieval.
Semantic embeddings are globally enabled and default to OpenAI when
`OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the control-plane environment. Local GGUF is
available as an explicit provider with `AFS_EMBED_PROVIDER=local`. For that
path, `afs query model download` asks the control plane helper to resolve,
download, and load the model server-side. On AFS Cloud, only an admin identity
can trigger that warm-up. The default local model is
`hf:ggml-org/embeddinggemma-300M-GGUF/embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0.gguf`. Redis
vector KNN is used when available, with direct vector ranking as its fallback.
Semantic queries read
existing embeddings; imports create embeddings in the background, and existing
workspaces can be prepared with
`afs fs <workspace> query index create --embeddings --wait`.

`query --files`, `query --csv`, `query --md`, and `query --xml` provide
QMD-style output formats for agents. `query --paths` keeps the simple path-only
output for scripts.

Regex and advanced matching can fall back to traversal. For regex-heavy scans on
a synced or mounted workspace, local `rg` is often the right tool.

Examples:

```bash
afs fs my-project grep "TODO"
afs fs my-project grep -l -i "disk full"
afs fs my-project grep -E "error|warning"
```

## Local Runtime Notes

Sync mode:

```bash
afs ws mount my-project ~/afs/my-project
cd ~/afs/my-project
```

Mount mode:

```bash
afs config set --mode mount --mount-backend nfs
afs ws mount my-project ~/afs/my-project
afs ws unmount my-project
```

If you run `afs ws mount` without a workspace, AFS lists available workspaces
and prompts you to choose one.

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| Cloud-hosted | You want browser auth, hosted UI, and managed workspace access. |
| Self-managed | You run your own control plane and UI with your own Redis database. |
| Standalone | You want the CLI to talk directly to Redis without the hosted UI. |

Local Self-managed development:

```bash
make web-dev
# control plane: http://127.0.0.1:8091
# Vite UI: printed by the dev server
```

Point the CLI at a Self-managed control plane:

```bash
afs config set config.source self-managed
afs config set controlPlane.url http://127.0.0.1:8091
afs ws mount getting-started ~/getting-started
```

## Handoff Template

When finishing an AFS task, report:

- Workspace name.
- Files changed.
- Commands or MCP tools used.
- Validation run and result.
- Checkpoint created, if any.
- Any restore, fork, or destructive action performed.

Example:

```text
Workspace: my-project
Changed: /src/app.ts, /README.md
Validation: npm test passed
Checkpoint: after-agent-readme-update
Notes: no checkpoint restore performed
```
