## Summary

AFS gives agents a filesystem-shaped workspace backed by Redis.

- The CLI, web UI, MCP server, and SDKs all talk to the same live workspace model.
- Local edits change live state immediately.
- Checkpoints are explicit restore points, not automatic snapshots.
- Workspaces can be mounted to real directories so shells, editors, scripts, and agents can all use ordinary paths.

## Quick start

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://afs.cloud/install.sh | bash
afs auth login
afs ws mount getting-started ~/getting-started
\`\`\`

## Why agents care

- One workspace model across CLI, MCP, SDKs, and browser flows.
- Real files and real directories instead of hidden chat state.
- Forkable workspaces for parallel agent lines of work.
- Checkpoint and restore without inventing a separate persistence layer.
